Human Dexter - A Realtime Pokedex of Human Beings 


Hudex will be a cross platform application to trace, identify and describe a human being based on his/her social media hashtags/ profile pictures/ email signatures and by the information shared by him/her on a website. Whether there is a comment somewhere on blog/facebook/twitter/emails/website/youtube channels or even any kind of information he/she shares on internet via phone/laptop/desktop.

The main objective of this framework will be to identify any particular human that you want to identify in a queue/park/mall/multiplex/stadium/Homes or any place you just have to upheld your camera (phone or laptop), the vison and imaging algorithm will compute a cognitive model of that human being on the backend server. This entire model will be powered by AI + ML framework that will scan the individuals physical appearance with his her profile on social media and search the more descriptive information like his/her hobbies interests etc. (NO SENSITIVE DATA WILL BE BREACHED AS THIS WOULD BE WORKING UPON ENCRYPTED PIPELINE THAT WOULD BE GOVERENED BY GOOGLE'S SECURITY AND ANDROID'S LINUX ARCHITECTURE)
The goodness of ML will make it understand a human more closely and more intelligently which would help Google and many security agencies in World to keep its citizen safe and environment free from bad sources.

As we all have heard about PokeDex that appeared in Pokemon Anime and have recently been shown in game titles "Pokemnon Go" & "Pokemon Master". So this sandwhiched layer of (Vison(AR)+AI+ML+Android+Google) will work in similar way the only difference will be it will tell about humans and give better understanding of each other.
